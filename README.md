# FIRE_capstone

The project overall is wanting to quantify burning and immediate vegetation regrowth from
forest fires with areas that have and have not had controlled burns as well as quantifying
geomorphic hazards and changes from the fires.

We also have socioecon component that we are using to investigate the effects of and provide
context to the Milli Fire that we are looking at. 

Thank you,
